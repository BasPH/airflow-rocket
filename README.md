# Airflow Rocket

This repository contains code accompanying this [Airflow blog post series](URL HERE).

Throughout the blog post series, I explain various Airflow concepts and give practices examples using the [Launch Library API](https://launchlibrary.net/docs/1.4/api.html), hence the repository name "Airflow Rocket".

**IMPORTANT**: The Dockerfile in this repository creates a single image containing all Airflow components, and examples and demos shown in the blog post. It is **NOT** intended for production usage! For more information on running Airflow in production, read the [blog post part 4](URL HERE).

Versions used:

- Airflow 1.10
- Python 3.6.6
- Launch Library API 1.4
